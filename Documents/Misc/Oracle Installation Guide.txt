The Oracle Express Edition installation automatically comes with "system" & "sys" accounts. During installation, we have to enter common password for both accounts. The standard password is "manager". However you can give different password.

Once installation completes, the %ORACLE_HOME%\bin folder should be automatically added to path.
c:\>echo %PATH%
C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\bin

Check oracle services are started.
Run--> services.msc
OracleServiceXE --"Started" status --> Statup type is "Automatic"
OracleXETNSListener --"Started" status --> Statup type is "Automatic"

Connect to SQL prompt
